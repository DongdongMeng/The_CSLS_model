# The_CSLS_model

There are four dynamic maps showing the processes of green algae detection by our context-sensitive level sets (CSLS) model.

Specifically, we use the dynamic map showing the evolution of our CSLS model which encourages converged level set contours to tightly surround green algae regions. Furthermore, the zero level set of our model form red contours that expected to separate the green algae region and the background region.
