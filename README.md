# The_CSLS_model

This is a context-sensitive level set model for green algae detection.

Requirements:

Matlab R2014a 

Test the model:

There is one investigated green algae image named demo.tif. You can run the main function The_CSLS_model.m for test.

The following four dynamic maps show the processes of green algae detection by our context-sensitive level sets (CSLS) model.

Specifically, we use the dynamic map showing the evolution of our CSLS model which encourages converged level set contours to tightly surround green algae regions. Furthermore, the zero level set of our model form red contours that are expected to separate the green algae region and the background region.
